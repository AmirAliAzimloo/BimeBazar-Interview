## State Management Using Redux and Redux-Toolkit

    This project utilizes Redux store as the global state management solution.
    The reducers/actions are created using redux-toolkit slices and all of the stores
    are completely typed using typescript.

    I personally think this small project did not need a global state management solution but
    I implemented it for the sake of the interview.
